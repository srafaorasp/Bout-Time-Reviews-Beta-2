# Bout Time Reviews: The Ultimate "Who Would Win?" Universe Simulator!

# Ever argued with your friends about which game is truly better? Now you can build an entire boxing universe to settle the score once and for all!

# 

# Bout Time Reviews is a unique head-to-head calculator and fight simulator that transforms real-world game data into an epic, persistent sports league. Create a roster of fighters powered by the Steam library, develop their careers, and guide them through a world of dynamic championships to see who will become a legend.

# 

# How It Works

# 1\. Create Your Universe

# Your journey begins at the Universe Setup screen. You have several ways to build your initial roster of at least 6 fighters:

# 

# Paste Steam App IDs: Add your favorite games by pasting a comma-separated list of their IDs.

# 

# Select from Top 100: Fetch a list of the 100 most-played games on Steam and curate your universe from a searchable list.

# 

# Load a Preset: Jump right in with a pre-selected list of diverse and competitive fighters.

# 

# Import a Universe: Load a .btr file from a previous session or one shared by a friend.

# 

# Local Championship Titles: The application will automatically create new local titles for any game genre shared by two or more fighters in your starting lineup!

# 

# 2\. Manage Your Roster

# The Roster Setup panel is your command center. From here you can:

# 

# View Champions: See the current title holders for all Major and Local divisions.

# 

# Scout Your Fighters: Get a complete list of every fighter in your universe. Click on any fighter to see a detailed information panel with their full record, stats, and title history.

# 

# Expand Your Universe: Add new contenders to your league by fetching lists of games from specific genres, either to create new title divisions or to bolster existing ones.

# 

# Manage Careers: Retire fighters to the Hall of Fame and watch for those who achieve the legendary "Grand Slam" status.

# 

# 3\. Set the Match \& Fight!

# Load any two fighters from your universe into the main event cards using the "Select from Universe" dropdowns. Check the odds, see if a title is on the line, and hit the Fight! button to watch the turn-by-turn simulation unfold!

# 

# Features

# Persistent Universe: Your entire universe—fighters, records, and champions—is automatically saved to your browser. Close the tab and your league will be waiting for you when you return. (Highly recommend you always export your universe!)

# 

# Dynamic Title System: Forget fixed championships. The game creates and manages a title scene based on the genres of the fighters you choose to include, making every universe unique.

# 

# Deep Simulation: Fights aren't just about the score. The simulation includes critical hits, a dynamic stamina system, underdog bonuses, and a live referee to make every bout unpredictable.

# 

# Career Progression: Fighters have persistent records. Victories, losses, and title reigns are tracked throughout their careers. A select few may even reach the Hall of Fame or achieve the hidden "Grand Slam" status.

# 

# Detailed Fighter Stats: Click on any fighter in your roster to see a full breakdown of their career, including every title they've ever held.

# 

# Universe Expansion Tools: Use the Roster Setup panel to scout for new talent in specific genres, allowing you to create new championships or bring in fresh challengers for existing ones.

# 

# Import \& Export: Save a backup of your entire universe as a .btr file to share with friends or move between computers.

# 

# Who will be crowned the undisputed champion in your universe? It's Bout Time you found out!

# AI Usage Statement

# This application was developed in a collaborative process between a human user and an AI Language Model.

# 

# AI Model: Gemini, a large language model developed by Google.

# 

# Role of AI: The AI's role was that of a programmer and technical writer. It was responsible for writing, debugging, refactoring, and documenting the application's code based on a series of iterative prompts and plans of action provided by the human user. All architectural decisions, feature requests, and logic refinements originated from the human user.

# 

# Process: The development followed a conversational, prompt-based workflow. The user provided a directive, the AI proposed a plan of action, the user approved or modified the plan, and the AI implemented the changes. This cycle was repeated for all features and bug fixes.

# 

# API Usage

# This application uses public data from the following third-party APIs. All data is handled client-side and is not stored or shared to or by the developer.

# 

# Steam API: Used to retrieve a game's name, review scores, developer, publisher, and genres when a fighter is created or updated.

# 

# SteamSpy API: Used to retrieve lists of games for the "Select from Top 100" and "Expand Universe" features.
